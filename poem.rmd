## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task,  
Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well  
Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask  
The tale he loves to tell.  
Rude spirits of the seething outer strife  

## Second Verse  
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In a world of whimsy, we'll take a stroll,  
To explore a topic that plays a role.  
Drugs and alcohol, oh, what a sight,  
But let's keep things fun, in Seussian delight!  

Now hear this, my friend, with an open ear,  
Why some may find these substances dear.  
They alter perception, make worries fade,  
Yet heed my words, for caution must be displayed.  
  
Oh, drugs and alcohol, they can make you soar,  
To places unseen, you'll long to explore.  
But remember, dear pal, balance is key,  
For too much of a good thing brings no glee.  
  
A sip of elixir, a puff of smoke,  
Moments of escape, a temporary cloak.  
They can lift spirits, release inhibitions,  
But excess indulgence leads to afflictions.  
  
In moderation, they offer respite,  
A moment of calm in a world so bright.  
But heed the warnings, my friend, beware,  
For abuse leads to despair and despair.  
  
Drugs and alcohol, like two-edged swords,  
Hold power immense, both blessings and hoards.  
So, choose wisely, my friend, don't be misled,  
For a balanced life, a clear mind's best-fed.  
   
In our Seussian journey, let's make it clear,  
That joy and merriment needn't appear,  
Through substances external, no, it's not so,  
Find happiness within, let your true self glow.  
  
For life's true beauty lies in simple pleasures,  
A hug, a laugh, heartfelt treasures.  
So, embrace the world, with a sober eye,  
And let your spirit, like Seuss, truly fly!
